# Conway's Game of Life

## Overview

To complete this challenge, you will need to complete the infamous Conway's Game of Life.

The purpose of this challenge is assess your not only your programming knowledge but to observe how you approach problems and implement solutions.

## The Challenge

Using the language you are most comfortable in, complete Conway's Game of Life. You need to create a variably defined grid that follows the rules listed below. Be sure to add a README with instructions or any requirements to run the project locally so we can pull your repository down and test it.

## Conway's Game of Life

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated". Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
